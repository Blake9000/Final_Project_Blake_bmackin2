Ideas & Selection Rationale
My idea is to create a network topology mapper.

This will map and visualize the relationships between devices on my home network. Each device has details like the hostname, IP, MAC, and their connections which will be collected and visualized.

Features
• Manage devices and their relationships
• Interactive network diagram with nodes
• View by category
• Import topology data from network scans or use
network scan in app (Using tools like nmap)

Branch Usage Reflections:
The initial branching strategy is to have a unique branch per feature before merging to main.
I called the initial branch "main_screen" as that will be the first feature.

Wireframe Notes:
Since there is no need to login, the UI can be a lot more simplistic. I was shooting for a simple windows UI with a draggable interior where the network diagram will appear. This will definitely change as I learn more of the requirements for this specific project.


Initialized the install.
I called the first app "main_screen" as this is what the user will primarily look at. The overall project is called "Network_Diagram" as that is the overall purpose of this project.



I am using a virtual environment called "django3". This virtual environment will hold django and any other libraries I find I need. If the 2 project libraries diverge, I will create seperate environments for both of them.
